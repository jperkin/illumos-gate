.Sh NAME
.Nm Penv_iter
.Nd iterate process environment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libproc
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo Penv_iter
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fa "proc_env_f *func"
.Fa "void *data"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Penv_iter
function iterates over the environment of the process represented by
.Fa P
and calls the callback
.Fa func
with the argument
.Fa data ,
the address of the environment variable and the key-value pair
once for each entry in the environment. For the full signature of the
.Ft proc_env_f
callback, see
.Xr libproc 3LIB .
.Pp
The function,
.Fa func Ns 's,
return value controls whether or not iteration is continued. If
.Fa func
returns zero, then iteration continues. However, if the function instead
returns non-zero, then it will terminate iteration and return that
value. It is recommended that callback functions do not return
.Sy -1
so as to distinguish between the failure of the
.Fn Penv_iter
function and the callback function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Penv_iter
function returns
.Sy 0 .
Otherwise, if there was an internal error, for example due to a
corrupted environment, then
.Sy -1
is returned. Otherwise, if the callback function
.Fa func
returns non-zero, then its return value will be returned instead.
